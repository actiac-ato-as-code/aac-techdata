This is the Tech and Data team page to help the larger project develop an adoption framework around the following deliverables.

2. Example contract language.
3. Showcase OSCAL integration with common Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) solutions (e.g., demonstrate how to generate OSCAL artifacts and how various tools can use them.)

This project started Oct 2022 and is estimated to end around December 2023.
