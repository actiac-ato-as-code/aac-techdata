Bijan Bahari - Distortion Tech:
I only found a couple of good white papers that I thought would apply to us as a group. The best information, in my opinion, that provides much light on how OSCAL can be used to automate ATO activities is from NIST.
 
OSCAL Layers and Models: https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/concepts/layer/
Nists page on the layers and Models of OSCAL provides an excellent view of how each piece works together; additionally this can be very helpful for understanding the interconnection between components for automating the ATO process.
 
Easy Dynamics OSCAL Whitepaper: https://www.easydynamics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/OSCAL-WP-1.pdf
Easy Dynamics has a little white paper that summarizes what OSCAL is and what it can do in addition to an overview of a framework for OSCAL adoption consisting of a 6 step process for use in the SDLC process. Here are those steps:
1.	Identify Target System
2.	Educate Stakeholders
3.	Select Target OSCAL artifacts
4.	Define Responsibility
5.	Develop Ongoing monitor approach 
6.	Implement OSCAL artifacts
 
Balisage Paper: The Model Made Me Do It! A Cautionary Tale from a Security Control Baseline Tool Developer : https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol26/html/Lubell01/BalisageVol26-Lubell01.html
 
This was an interesting read from a security control tool developer. I wasn’t sure whether to include it, but I wanted to share for the larger group to read. The abstract is for reference: "Even the best written specifications can be complicated documents to read and understand. Normative prose is often supported by tables and diagrams intended to clarify the specification. What happens when a tool developer interprets those clarifying features as a different model than the prose intends? What does this say about relying on derived data models in tools that support the specification? A cautionary tale involving security control baselines from National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53 provides some answers — and insights."
